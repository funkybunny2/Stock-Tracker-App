# Stock Tracker App

The Stock Tracker App is a web application that allows users to track the latest stock information for a specific stock symbol. It fetches data from a stock market API and displays the stock's name, symbol, price, and, optionally, change and percent change.

- Click the "Track" button to fetch and display stock data.
- View the stock's name, symbol, and price.
- Optional: Display the stock's change and percent change if available in the API response.

## Getting Started

2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.

3. Customize the `js/display.js` file with your API key and provider details.

4. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to use the app.

## Usage
